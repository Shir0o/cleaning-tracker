// Regression guard for https://github.com/MaikuB/flutter_local_notifications
// scheduled-notification delivery: the plugin (v16.3+) ships NO receivers in
// its own manifest and requires the app to declare
// ScheduledNotificationReceiver (alarm delivery) and
// ScheduledNotificationBootReceiver (re-arm after reboot) itself.
//
// If either receiver is missing, Android drops the scheduled alarm broadcast
// silently: the reminder never appears, and the app only ever shows it via the
// immediate-fire path when it is opened.
